Overview
==========

BioGears速 source code is hosted here and will be developed through this public repository to encourage community facing development. In addition, we also support official stable releases. Our latest deployment (found under releases) is still in a beta phase, and is intended to be an intermediate release to showcase the capabilities of the BioGears速 Physiology Engine. The current version of the software includes examples of all types of engine interfaces, but does not include all of the functionality or physiologic systems that will be present in the final product. This version of the software is meant to elicit feedback and enhance community involvement in establishing end product expectations.

What is BioGears速
------------------
BioGears速 is a C++ based, open source, multi-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux), comprehensive human physiology engine that will drive medical education, research, and training technologies. BioGears enables accurate and consistent physiology simulation across the medical community. The engine can be used as a standalone application or integrated with simulators, sensor interfaces, and models of all fidelities.

BioGears high-level objectives
--------------------------------
* Create a publicly available physiology research platform that enables accurate and consistent simulated physiology across training applications
* Lower the barrier to create medical training content
* Engage the community to develop and extend physiology models
* Meet the training needs of the military
* Expand the body of knowledge regarding the use of simulated physiology for medical education

Building Source
======
Refer to our GitHub Wiki for build requirements [here](https://github.com/BioGearsEngine/core/wiki)


Structure 
------------
The BioGears source is structured as follows:
- `cmake/` - Custom CMake scripts needed by the build system, including some JAVA search behavior overrides
  - `common/` - package files for common CMake deps
  - `toolchains/` - Templates for CMake toolchain files
- `share/` - Non-source files
  - `astyle/`  - Astyle template for formating source (deprecated)
  - `data/` - BioGears configuration files for various scenarios 
  - `doc/` - BioGears documentation files (doxygen, markdown, ...)
  - `etc/` - Other
  - `jar/` - Jar files for BioGears JAVA based components hopefully deprecated soon
  - `xsd/` - XSD definition files for the Common Data Model
- `projects/`
  - `biogears` - Main Engine Source for building libbiogears libbiogears-cdm
  - `biogears-common` - Helper framework for c++ with no third party dependencies
  - `bg-cli` - Primary Command Line Utility for using BioGears 
  - `howto/` - libbiogears SDK examples
  - `java/`  - JNI utilities for running biogears
  - `unit/`  - Unit test harness used for testing libbiogears components
