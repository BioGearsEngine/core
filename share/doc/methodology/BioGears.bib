  Volume                   = {82},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the largest component
of daily energy demand in Western societies. Previous studies indicated
that BMR is highly variable, but the cause of this variation is
disputed. All studies agree that variation in fat-free mass (FFM)
plays a major role, but effects of fat mass (FM), age, sex, and the
hormones leptin, triiodothyrionine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) remain
uncertain.
Objective: We partitioned the variance in BMR into within- and
between-subject effects and explored the roles of FFM, FM, bone
mineral content, sex, age, and circulating concentrations of plasma
leptin, T3, and T4.
Design: This was a cross-sectional study of 150 white adults from
northeast Scotland, United Kingdom.
Results: Only 2% of the observed variability in BMR was attributable
to within-subject effects, of which 0.5% was analytic error. Of
the remaining variance, which reflected between-subject effects,
63% was explained by FFM, 6% by FM, and 2% by age. The effects
of sex and bone mineral content were not significant (P  0.05).
Twenty-six percent of the variance remained unexplained. This variation
was not associated with concentrations of circulating leptin or
T3. T4 was not significant in women but explained 25% of the
residual variance in men.
Conclusions: Our data confirm that both FFM and FM are significant
contributors to BMR. When the effect of FM on BMR is removed,
any association with leptin concentrations disappears, which
suggests that previous links between circulating leptin concentrations
and BMR occurred only because of inadequate control for the
effects of FM.},

  Abstract                 = {The Harris Benedict equations (HBE) were derived from indirect calorimetric

data obtained in 239 normal subjects. Using these data and additonal data published by Benedict,

which were obtained from subjects spanning a wider age range (n = 98), the present study

evaluated the relationship between measured resting energy expenditure and age, sex, and

predicted body cell mass (BCM). When the additional subjects from the subsequently published

series are included, the regression equations, standard error ofthe estimate, and 95% confidence

limits are similar to the original equations. The HBE estimate resting energy expenditure of a

normal subject with a precision of 14%. Resting energy expenditure is directly related to the size

of the 8CM and is independent of age and sex. The variables of height, weight, age, and sex in

the HBE reflect the relationship between body weight and the BCM. Indirect calorimetry and

body composition measurements were performed in both normally nourished and malnourished

patients (n = 74) to assess the accuracy of the HBE in malnourished patients. Malnutrition is

associated with an increase in resting oxygen consumption (V02) which becomes apparent only

when V02 is expressed as a function of the BCM. There is no difference in resting VO2 between

the sexes when expressed as a function of BCM. A regression equation was derived from the

Harris Benedict data to predict resting V02 from age, height, weight, and sex. Predicted VO2 was

not significantly different from measured VO2 for the normally nourished patients (n = 33)

whereas in the malnourished (n = 41) predicted VO2 underestimated the measured value. The

HBE accurately predict resting energy expenditure in normally nourished individuals with a

precision of ?14%, but are unreliable in the malnourished patient.},

these data may be ofcomparative value for nutritionists
and clinicians concerned with body composition ofpatients with
wasting diseases. The data were collected over 20 y in our laboratory
by using the same densitometric procedure. A significant
increase in FFM:ht occurs during the preadolescent and adolescent
years. The adolescent spurt continues for a longer period
for boys than for girls, resulting in a significant gender difference
beginning at ??age 16 y and continuing throughout adulthood.
A decline in FFM:ht, not statistically significant, appears to occur
in men > 60 y of age, and a significant decline occurs among
women > 50 y of age (a < 0.01). Thus, both gender- and agerelated
trends that have implications for the interpretation of
comparative body-composition status are suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Lower body negative pressure as a model to study progression to acute hemorrhagic shock in
humans. J Appl Physiol 96: 1249?1261, 2004; 10.1152/japplphysiol.01155.2003.?
Hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in both civilian and battlefield trauma.
Survival rates increase when victims requiring immediate intervention are correctly
identified in a mass-casualty situation, but methods of prioritizing casualties based
on current triage algorithms are severely limited. Development of effective procedures
to predict the magnitude of hemorrhage and the likelihood for progression to
hemorrhagic shock must necessarily be based on carefully controlled human
experimentation, but controlled study of severe hemorrhage in humans is not
possible. It may be possible to simulate hemorrhage, as many of the physiological
compensations to acute hemorrhage can be mimicked in the laboratory by applying
negative pressure to the lower extremities. Lower body negative pressure (LBNP)
sequesters blood from the thorax into dependent regions of the pelvis and legs,
effectively decreasing central blood volume in a similar fashion as acute hemorrhage.
In this review, we compare physiological responses to hemorrhage and
LBNP with particular emphasis on cardiovascular compensations that both share in
common. Through evaluation of animal and human data, we present evidence that
supports the hypothesis that LBNP, and resulting volume sequestration, is an
effective technique to study physiological responses and mechanisms associated
with acute hemorrhage in humans. Such experiments could lead to clinical algorithms
that identify bleeding victims who will likely progress to hemorrhagic shock
and require lifesaving intervention(s).},

air of subjects working at various metabolic rates at ambient temperatures between -40 ?C and 20 ?C in
order to calculate respiratory heat loss. Measurements of the respired air temperature and water vapour
content were made for five subjects while they either stood or walked on a treadmill. The results indicated
that the maximum respired air temperature varied slightly with the ambient air temperature but changes
in metabolic rate, respiration rate and breathing frequency had no apparent effect on the expired air
temperature under the conditions studied. The relative humidity of the respired air was found to be close
to saturation in the extreme-cold environments. Heat loss due to respiration was between 25 and 30% of
the resting metabolic and between 15 and 20~o of the working metabolic rate.},

  Abstract                 = {Five young normal subjects (NS) and six middle-aged patients with chronic, lowoutput,
congestive heart failure (HFP) were studied before and after 10 minutes of
exposure to hypovolemia induced by negative pressure (30 mm Hg) applied to the
lower body. ECG, respirometer, and catheters placed in the subclavian artery and
superior vena cava permitted measurements of heart rate (HR), respiration rate,
arterial and central venous pressures (CVP), and cardiac output (CO). In the group
of NS, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) rose moderately, while CVP fell 4.3 mm Hg;
CO, stroke volume (SV), stroke work (SW), and central blood volume (CBV) fell
about 20%, whereas blood pressure and HR showed little change. In the group of HFP,
control hemodynamic values were generally abnormal. In four patients the response
to hypovolemia was similar to that of NS. Two patients with advanced heart failure
showed no change or a rise in CO, SV, and SW in the face of a fall in CVP (3.1 and
3.7 mm Hg), no change or a fall in SVR, and a rise in CBV. It is concluded that HFP
does not respond to hypovolemia in a consistent manner. Certain patients with advanced
failure demonstrated abnormal responses to induced hypovolemia, the causes for which
are complex.},

outdoor environment by means of a wind tunnel test and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
analysis. A comparison of the results shows that the CFD analysis is sufficiently accurate. We
conduct a sensitivity analysis based on CFD analysis for the mean convective heat transfer coefficient
for the human body with changing values of velocity and turbulence intensity. We then develop a
formula for the mean convective heat transfer coefficient for the human body in the outdoor
environment that can evaluate both the influences of velocity and turbulence intensity of the wind on
the human body. This formula is more effective for evaluating thermal comfort in the outdoor
environment where there is large turbulence, because conventional formulae can evaluate only the
influences of velocity. While the conventional formula produces an unrealistic increase in sensible
temperature, the new formula causes the temperature to decrease, which is more reasonable, based
on an analysis of thermal comfort in a tree-planted city block.},

	issn = {0195-9131},
	abstract = {The heart consumes lactate under resting conditions in normal healthy people. A limited number of studies have measured lactate exchange across the heart during exercise by using simultaneous arterial and coronary sinus catheterization. In general, exercise results in an increase in the rate of lactate uptake, which is due both to the increases in myocardial blood flow and lactate extraction from rest to exercise. Lactate extraction by the myocardium during submaximal exercise (40-60\% VO2max) is largely dependent upon the concentration of lactate in arterial blood. Studies using a continuous infusion of 14C-lactate tracer have demonstrated that essentially all of the lactate taken up during exercise is immediately oxidized to CO2 in the myocardium. In addition, lactate tracer studies indicate that healthy myocardium simultaneously consumes and produces lactate under conditions of net lactate consumption. Moderate intensity exercise (40\% VO2max) does not result in an increase in the rate of myocardial lactate production above resting values. Thus, the heart takes up lactate in proportion to the rate of lactate delivery to the myocardium both at rest and during exercise. Exercise that elicits an increase in the arterial lactate concentration above resting values results in an increase in the relative contribution of lactate oxidation to myocardial oxidative metabolism.},
