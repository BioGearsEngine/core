Our latest deployment is still in a beta phase, and is intended to be an intermediate release to 
showcase the capabilities of the %BioGears&reg; Physiology Engine. 
The current version of the software includes examples of all types
of engine interfaces, but does not include all of the functionality or
physiologic systems that will be present in the final product. This
version of the software is meant to elicit feedback and enhance
community involvement in establishing end product expectations.

## Dedication

This software is dedicated to **N. Ty Smith, M.D.**, physician, professor, mentor, friend, and founding director of the Pacific Academy of Ecclesiastical Music (PACEM).

Dr. Smith was born in Iowa and graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Smith served on the faculties at Stanford Medical Center and the University of California at San Diego. He was a Visiting Professor at the University of Washington, Institute of Medical Physics in Holland, University of Wisconsin, and University of Otago in New Zealand. Dr. Smith also served at Children's Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, Massachusetts General Hospital, U.S. Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia, U.S. Veterans Administration Hospital in San Diego, and Dunedin Hospital in New Zealand.

Dr. Smith, along with Ken Starko M.Sc., created "Body Simulation" in the 1990s. Body Simulation models and their interfaces were used for pharmacologic experimentation, testing, teaching, and training by device manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, professional associations, and government agencies. %BioGears builds directly from this vision and legacy.

It was Dr. Smith's fervent wish that his work continue long into the future to advance scientific discovery, improve the safety of healthcare, and ultimately save lives.
