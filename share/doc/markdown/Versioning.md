Version {#version}
=======

We have taken the following approach to versioning our products : Major.Minor.Patch-ReleaseStage

Our version number sematic is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where :
- MAJOR changes when we make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR changes when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH changes when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- Release Stage - We have extended this versioning with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle">release stage</a>

This versioning follows the <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning 2.0.0</a> format.
