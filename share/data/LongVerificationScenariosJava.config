# Syntax
# Each group tag indicates the beginning of a new verification set which will be summarized and sent out in its own email.  
# Notice how information from the header (subject, recipients, etc.) can be specified again under a group tag to override the defaults.

# DASH = Don't Run
# A line that begins with a dash tells the verifier not to run the scenario, but to still include its results in the report.  
# This allows us to run and generate a quick basic report and include these results in later emails without re-running the scenarios.

# ASTERISK = Expected Failure (Run Yellow)
# A line that begins with an asterisk tells the verifier that failure is to be expected from the scenario.  
# These scenarios will not be run and will be placed in the separate yellow block of the email.
