#pragma once

// Let's try to make this as lightweight as possible so that CCompoundUnit
// objects can be efficiently manipulated within the context of an enclosing
// physical quantity object (name TBD: PhysicsQuantity? DimensionedQuantity?
// How about just Quantity?) when arithmetic with them needs to be done. This
// means maximizing use of inline functions, even those that manipulate the
// CUEVecType elements, which in turn requires dealing with Microsoft's BS for
// exporting STL classes and classes containing STL data objects as data members.
// (See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/168958) The only STL class that you can do
// this with is vector<>, but fortunately that's all we need here. Usually, I get
// around this by declaring the data objects as pointers to STL template
// instantiations that I dynamically allocate and manipulate in non-inline functions,
// but since we're going for inline methods here, doing so wouldn't buy me anything,
// so I may as well make them first class data members. That may have the added
// benefit of coaxing out any helpful warning messages that the compiler might
// mistakenly think are not relevant when the data members are merely pointers to
// STL classes. -CRV

// Note: The ordering of the following two declarations is vital. The above-mentioned
// knowledge base article only talks about exporting the vector class that I'm
// explicitly instantiating, but that results in an error message about the allocator
// needing to be exported. Adding the allocator export after the vector export didn't
// solve the problem. But the paragraph about nested classes in the KB article alludes to
// a circular dependency that manifests itself as different error messages depending
// on which thing you export first. So, on a hunch, I reversed the order, and voila!
